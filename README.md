Payoo - Mobile Banking Web App 💸
A fully interactive, front-end simulation of a mobile banking application. This project demonstrates dynamic DOM manipulation, state management, and modern UI design without relying on heavy JavaScript frameworks.

🔑 Test Credentials
To explore the application and test the functionality, use the following demo login details:

Mobile Number: 01234567890

4-Digit PIN: 1234

✨ Features
User Authentication: A simulated login portal that validates the user's mobile number and PIN before granting access to the dashboard.

Dynamic Balance Management: Users can interact with features like "Add Money," "Cashout," "Send Money," and "Pay Bill." The main account balance updates dynamically based on the transaction logic.

Promo System: A functional "Get Bonus" section that validates promo codes and adds funds to the account.

Real-Time Transaction History: Every successful action is recorded in a dynamic ledger, displaying the transaction type, amount, target account, and a precise timestamp.

Interactive UI/UX: Utilizes modern modals, dropdown menus, and alert dialogues for a smooth user experience.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5: For semantic page structure.

Tailwind CSS & DaisyUI: For rapid, responsive styling and pre-built, clean UI components.

Vanilla JavaScript: For handling all business logic, calculations, event listeners, and dynamic DOM updates.

💻 Getting Started

🛣️ Future Scope
This application currently serves as a robust front-end showcase. As I continue my journey toward becoming a full-stack software engineer, future updates for this project will involve building out a complete backend architecture (such as Node.js or Python) and integrating a real database to handle genuine user sessions, persistent data storage, and secure authentication.
